PDF Replace
===========

A tool that provides a pragmatic solution to PDF-generation, by
providing a fixes feature-set for PDF data-interpolation, or
simply put search-and-replace.

## Getting started

The user provides a custom PDF-template with placeholders for text
and image replacements. Please see the Java API for more detailed
information on the available features.

## Development

This is a pretty straight-forward Java-project, use `mvn` to build,
test and deploy. Happy hacking!
