PDF Builder
===========

A library tool that provides a pragmatic solution to PDF-generation
and manipulation.

## General Idea

Instead of being a platform, with template authoring and such
features, this library aids in more simple text interpolation,
in already existing PDF templates.

The intent is aimed at the 80% use cases - there's a pretty
PDF document, where some values, or placeholder, can be easily
replaced.

## Development

This is a pretty straight-forward Java-project, use `mvn` to build,
test and deploy. Happy hacking!
